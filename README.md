## 🔬 Data Exploration & Market Intelligence

### Distribution Analysis for Strategic Positioning

**Success Score Distribution Insights:**
The success score distribution reveals a clear bimodal pattern with peaks around 0.25-0.30 and 0.60-0.65, indicating natural market segmentation between average-performing apps and high-performing premium applications. This distribution validates MyYouthSpan's strategy to target the upper tier (0.6+ success score) rather than competing in the crowded middle market.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad721c09-59de-4789-9083-33cab89ac570)


**Revenue Distribution Analysis:**
The revenue distribution displays a classic power law pattern with extreme right skew, where >90% of apps generate minimal revenue while a small number capture disproportionate value. This concentration effect reinforces MyYouthSpan's positioning strategy for premium market capture.

                      df['feat_wearable'] + df['feat_community'] + 
                      df['feat_coach'])

# Price category segmentation
df['price_category'] = pd.cut(df['price'], bins=[-0.1, 0, 2, 5, 10, 100], 
                             labels=['Free', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Premium'])
